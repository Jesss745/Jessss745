<h2> Jess's Portfolio - Kinda! </h2>
This repository contains my (potentially) future self coded portfolio that includes my past works as a designer and some visualization (currently only SVG art) that is created through what I've learnt from IAT 355 - Visual Analytics :)

The `index.html` page is currently the only page up from my final portfolio. I did use some previous code that I used for my first iteration of my webite so the CSS is still very messy. `index.html` contains a brief overview of who I am. `style.css` contains all my styling for all the webpages and `token.css` contains my personal color styles that I used. I separated it to make it easier to edit for me personally. I included some javascript on this page using  `main.js`

As this site kinda included some elements of my old portfolio, I also included some images and SVG's I made to showcase my old work and for my footed. these are in the `img` and `svg` folder. While this isn't the requirement, I hope additional pages is okay.

The `vis.html` page contains some visualization I've created using SVG. One is hard coded, the other is done through javascript that is done in the `vis.js` file :)
