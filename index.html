                <p> I'm an interdisciplinary UX designer based in Vancouver whose passionate about bringing my ideas and product into reality through my experince creating illustrations and design. I take inspiration from all my past experiences and the skillsets I've developed through my time as a student at Simon Fraser University studying Interactive Arts and Technology where they've taught me various skills from creating 3D product mockups to coding an interactive game to help with learning. </p>

                <p> Outside of school, I'm a huge foodie who loves to try new cuisine and rating them in my own personal journal to share with family and friends. I also love coming up with new illustrations of characters I enjoy from various media I consume. </p>
