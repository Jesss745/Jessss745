      <!-- visualization goes into this div you can create multiple divs and give them IDs -->
      <h3> Visualization 1: Global Sales by Genre and Platform</h3>
      <p> For this visualization, I went with a bar chart. It lets me quickly showcase each data points and
        simultaneously lets users do comparisons across the different categories (genre and platforms) quickly. </p>
      <p> Globally, Action games dominates global sales.
        For platforms though, PS2 games has had the most units sold.</p>
      <div id="v1genre"> </div>
      <div id="v1plat"> </div>

      <h3> Visualization 2: Sales Over Time by Platform and Genre</h3>
      <p> I've created 2 visuals to present this information. The sales over time by genre and by platform. I had
        filtered both
        data set to exclude data that had the "N/A" listed for the year to avoid skewing the data set.
      </p>

      <p> For the genre, I went with an area chart. </p>
      <p> This chart allowed me to see when the first games of each genre’s were created.
        For example, I found out that the first game in the Role-playing genre was released in 1986. <br>

        The most units sold from a specific genre in a year was was from games released in 2008 for the Action genre.
        On the other hand, Strategy seems to be the least popular genre overall.</p>
      <div id="v2genre"> </div>

      <p> For the sales over time by platform portion, I went with an line chart and a circles chart to indicate how
        much sales happened within the year. </p>
      <p> So to start, I noticed that the PC is the longest lasting platform in this list with games still being created
        for it today. This might also be due to dataset not including games with the “N/A” years,
        but the TG16 only had games released for it for 1994, making it the shortest lasting platform. <br>

        The Wii had the best selling year on 2006, indicated by the size or the circle. <br>
        It’s also cool to know that the 2600 is the oldest platform on this list while XOne and PS4 is the newest
        consoles (released in 2013). </p>
      <div id="v2plat"> </div>

      <h3> Visualization 3: Regional Sales vs. Platform</h3>
      <p> For this one, a bar chart that uses facet to separate each region from each other:)</p>
      <p> In Europe, the top 3 most popular platform is the PS3 followed by the PS2 and the X360. <br>
        In North America, the X360, PS2, and the Wii is their most popular platforms <br>
        In other regions, the PS2, PS3, and the X360 tops the charts<br>
        Japan differs the most from other region. Their top 3 is the DS, the PS, and then the PS2
      </p>
      <div id="v3"> </div>

      <h3> Visualization 4: All About Nintendo </h3>
      <p> For this portion of the task, I decided to do a general analysis of Nintendo (the game publisher) as a whole!
        <br>
        I've always been a huge fan of all of their games, and they're really the only company where I actually somewhat
        keep up with their releases. As such, I decided this is a cool opportunity to analyze them. </p>
      <ul>
        <p>In this portion I’ll be analyzing various things: </p>
        <li> How Nintendo performs compared to other publishers </li>
        <li> Nintendo Games that have sold over 10 million units </li>
        <li> Platforms Nintendo has made games for </li>
        <li>An overview of Nintendo’s best selling genre and ones they’ve made the most games for </li>
        <li>How Nintendo performs across regions </li>
      </ul>

      <p> So, I'm sure we've all heard about Nintendo. Maybe even played a game or two from them.
        But, did you know how dominant they are in the video game industry when it comes to their sales number? <br>
        Feel free to hover over the pie chart to see the names, genres, and units sold for that game.
      </p>
      <div id="v4circle"> </div>
      <p> Here is a comparisson on how each Nintendo game performed compared to each other. <br>
        Its crazy becayse Nintendo has more games that have sold 10 million units compared to the
        the other 5 publishers in this data COMBINED! </p>
      <div id="v4bestsells"> </div>
      <p> Nintendo is also unique compared to other publishers because they
        also make their own consoles and primarily only create games that are usually (not always!)
        only playble on those specific consoles (unless you pirate them perhaps...). </p>
      <div id="v4console"> </div>
      <p> Nintendo definitely has a favorite genre though, and it sells really well!</p>
      <p> If you hover over the bar chart, you will see the total number of games released for that genre. </p>
      <div id="v4genre"> </div>
      <p> Finally, here's a quick visualization on how each genre performs across regions!</p>
      <div id="v4populargenre"> </div>
      <p> That's all from me, thank you for joining me on this!</p>
