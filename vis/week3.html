      <h2> Visualization 1: Global Sales by Genre and Platform</h2>
      <p> I've created 2 visuals to present this information. 
      The total global sales by genre and by platform</p>
      <div id="v1genre"> </div>
      <div id="v1plat"> </div>

      <h2> Visualization 2: Sales Over Time by Platform and Genre</h2>
      <p> I've created 2 visuals to present this information. The sales over time by genre and by platform. <br> The lines can be clicked to highlight the trajectory for a specific genre or platform</p>
      <div id="v2genre"> </div>
      <div id="v2plat">  </div>

      <h2> Visualization 3: Regional Sales vs. Platform</h2>
      <p> For this one, it's technically only 1 visual but they're separated using facet :)</p>
      <div id="v3"> </div>

      <h2> Visualization 4: All About Nintendo </h2>
      <p> Now for the highlight of this task, I decided to do a general analysis
        of Nintendo (the game publisher) as a whole! <br> I've always been a huge fan of
        all of their games, and they're really the only company where I actually
        somewhat keep up with their releases. As such, I decided this is a cool opportunity
        to just be a bit nerdy and talk about them :)</p>
      <p> So, I'm sure we've all heard about Nintendo. Maybe even played a game or two from them. 
        But, did you know how dominant they are in the video game industry when it comes to their sales number? <br>
        Feel free to hover over the pie chart to see the names, genres, and units sold for that game.
      </p>
      <div id="v4circle"> </div>
      <p> You can't say they're not doing well either. They have so many games that have sold more than
        10 million units! <br>
        Its crazy becayse Nintendo has more games that have sold 10 million units compared to the 
        the other 5 publishers in this data COMBINED! </p>
        <div id="v4console"> </div>
      <p> Nintendo is unique compared to other publishers because they
          also make their own consoles and primarily only create games that are usually (not always!)
          only playble on those specific consoles (unless you pirate them perhaps...). </p>
      <div id="v4bestsells"> </div>
      <p> Nintendo definitely has a favorite genre though, and it sells really well!</p>
      <div id="v4genre"> </div>
      <p> Finally, here's a quick visualization on how each genre performs across regions!</p>
      <div id="v4populargenre"> </div>
      <p> That's all from me, thank you for joining me on this!</p>
