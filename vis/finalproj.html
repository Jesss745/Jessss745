          <h4> It's frustrating for players to spend a lot of money on an item that isn't guaranteed</h4>
          <p> Generally, the gacha mechanic is introduced to a free to play game so the developers
            could still make a profit out of it. The items that the player receive got be purely cosmetic
            (doesn't add anything to the gameplay) or actually gives a boost for the player (more attack, new skills)
          </p>

          <p> Because its not guaranteed, it creates a disparity between players who don't spend money on the game
            and players that do. It's also just frustrating for players to see game devs seemingly caring more about
            profit than the players
          </P>

        <h4> The gacha games market is also expected to have a compound annual growth rate of 8.8%</h4>

        <div id="gachaMarketTrend"> </div>

        <p> The market is just going to continue growing exponetially. Since it likely to be around 985.7
          million by 2032, its save to say that gacha games will continue getting released</p>

              <h4> As a player, Its frustrating dealing with gacha mechanis!</h4>
              <p> While in app purchases are not required, some games use tactics to make them appealing (timers before
                the deal runs out, a "sale" on the product). On top of that, its very easy to fall behind in these
                games compared to players who are able to spend money on the game to proceed. As such, gacha games
                have a reputation of only existing as a quick cash grab. </p>

              <p> By making it so theres only a small chance for players to get the rare items. these companies
                encourage players to spend money in hopes of increasing those chances. However, there's no clear
                proof of this. The question arises on whether the drop rates offered by these games actually affects
                how players spend on the game or if it is other factors that players may have not considered.

          <h4> So, is profit the reason why so many games nowadays include a gacha system?</h4>
          <h5> Let's look at the performance of the 50 most profitable mobile games that contains a gacha system in
            2024. </h5>

    <h3> Looking at the Data</h3>
  </div>

  <section class="week3Vis">
    <div class="container">
      <h4> What are the 50 most profitale mobile games in 2024? (up until October) </h4>
      <p> The following is a breakdown of these games alongside a breakdown of their genre's and what year the game was
        released in.
      </p>

      <h5> Filter the data by clicking on the genre list or the years!</h5>
      <div id="vis1"></div>

      <p> So in 2024, 14 out of the 50 most games fall under the role-playing genre, indicating that a lot of spenders
        tend to prefer games in that genre.
        On top of that, at least 10 games were released in 2024. This could mean that some players are simply
        spending to consume all the possible contents in that game as quickly as possible. It may also be
        recency bias where players feel more inclined to spend their money to games they just begun.
      </p>

      <p> It seems to be a linear scale in regards to when each game were released.
        The newer the game, the more likely it is to remain on the most profitable chart. Which, again, is ikely
        because the older the game, the more bored a player might be when playing it because they may think that
        they've experienced everything the game has to offer.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h5> Let's look at the best performing game in 2024</h5>
      <div id="vis2"> </div>
      <p> While there is no specific trend, it's clear that the revenue gacha games generate
        tend to fluctuate a lot. Some months could be way more profitable than others and the rates
        offered by the games would not have changed. It would be the content that change. Which indicates
        that it isn't the rates thats affected how players spend, its the content they produce.
      </p>

      <h3> So, lets look at Honkai Star Rail</h3>

      <h3> So, how does other games compare to Honkai? (or with each other)</h3>

      <h4> Is there a correlation between drop rates and revenue?</h4>
      <p> Based on Honkai: Star Rail's performance, it seems that revenue is affected by the characters popularity more
        than anything. However, does drop rates still play a part in this?</p>
      <p> The following chart looks at the correlation between a game's drop rate with a games revenue. It also looks at
        whether the amount of new players joining the game affects the amount of profit a game gets. An argument could
        be made that new players might be more
        likely to spend money on these games to catch up with more veteran players </p>

      <div id="vis4"> </div>

      <p> Based on this chart, it does look like the revenue isn't affected by the drop rates offered by each game as
        there is a variety of them all throughout. While it seemed like games with lower drop rates tend to have more
        profits,there are still a lot of instances of other games with the same drop rate that doesn't produce even 1/10 of
        another games profit.

      <hr>
      <div class="regionTime">
        <div class="text"> 
      <h4> Finally, is there region that tends to generate the most revenue? </h4>
      <p> While not always the case, mobile games tends to have 3 different servers for the players; Global, Japanese,
        and Chinese servers.</p>
      <p> Depending on where the video game publisher is from, mobile games tend to release in first locally in China or
        Japan. As these games grow in popularity, they
        would create a global server for the rest of the world to be able to properly understand the story of the game.
        This isn't always the case of course
        and some games, like Genshin Impact, released their Chinese and Global servers together. </p>

      <p> There is a believe that the reason some games make a lot of money is their Asian players,
        specifically Japanese and Chinese player. As such, games tend to market themselves
        to that market in hopes of getting them to spend money. </p>

      <h5>Mobile gacha games tend to be the most profitable in Japan </h5>
      <p> Considering "gacha" comes from the Japanese word "Gachapon" and generally, a lot of gacha games comes from
        Japan, this makes a lot of sense!
        With gacha games being a common occurance there, Japanese players are likely more willing to spend on these
        games as its a bit more normalized. </p>

      <p> It is important to note that when China generates revenue, it generates a LOT compared to other regions. If
        you were to look at <b> Love and Deepsace</b>, revenue
        generated by the Chinese servers tends to be at least 5 times what Global and Japan servers combined generate in
        a month. While this is the most drastic difference,
        this can also be seen with titmes such as <b> Genshin Impact, Honkai Star: Rail, and Arknights</b>. </p>
      <p> With this in mind, it makes sense why some video games tend to market itself to a Japanese or Chinese audience
        first, they really are the big
        moneymakers when it comes to it.</p>

        <h4> Profit for these games come from the characters, or the gameplay</h4>
        <p> With gacha games either constantly releasing new characters, re-releasing popular characters,
          or just making new items that is useful for well liked characters, there will be players
          that are so attached to them that they'd be willing to spend money to get those items.</p>

        <p> Drop rates do play a part in terms of longevity. Games released between 2012 to 2017
          had an overall higher drop rate compared to games released in 2018 onwards. </p>

        <div id="vis6"> </div>

        <p> Video games always want to makes their veteran players happy while ensuring they make it
          fun and accessible for new players to maintain their game's longevity by replenishing
          the player base, preventing decline as older players may stop playing and generating
          potential revenue streams from new users.
        </p>

        <h4> So if the rates are bad, no one wants to play the game!</h4>
        <p> Its very important for there to be good balance on the drop rates a game offers alongside the the gameplay
          and storyline to ensure the game can succeed!

          <h4> It is important to keep in mind that Gacha can be a dangerous mechanic.</h4>
          <p> Gacha as a mechanic is similar to gambling. It doesn't help that when gamers love get attached
            to a character, a lot of them would do ANYTHING to get them. As a video game developer, it is important to
            be aware
            of these risks and still keep a players wellbeing in mind when using the gacha mechanic.
