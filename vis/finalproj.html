          <h4>It's frustrating for players to spend a lot of money on an item that isn't guaranteed</h4>
          <p>
            Generally, the gacha mechanic is introduced in a free-to-play game so the developers
            can still make a profit. The items that players receive can be purely cosmetic
            (doesn't add anything to the gameplay) or actually provide a boost for the player (e.g., more attack, new skills).
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Because it's not guaranteed, it creates a disparity between players who don't spend money on the game
            and players who do. It's also frustrating for players to see game developers seemingly caring more about
            profit than their player base.

        <h4>The gacha games market is also expected to have a compound annual growth rate of 8.8%</h4>
        <div id="gachaMarketTrend"></div>
  
        <p>
          The market is just going to continue growing exponentially. Since it is likely to reach around 985.7
          million by 2032, it's safe to say that gacha games will continue getting released.

              <h4>As a player, it's frustrating dealing with gacha mechanics!</h4>
              <p>
                While in-app purchases are not required, some games use tactics to make them appealing (e.g., timers before
                the deal runs out, a "sale" on the product). On top of that, it's very easy to fall behind in these
                games compared to players who are able to spend money to progress. As such, gacha games
                have a reputation for only existing as a quick cash grab.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                By making it so there's only a small chance for players to get rare items, these companies
                encourage players to spend money in hopes of increasing those chances. However, there's no clear
                proof of this. The question arises whether the drop rates offered by these games actually affect
                how players spend on the game or if it is other factors that players may not have considered.

          <h4>So, is profit the reason why so many games nowadays include a gacha system?</h4>
          <h5>Let's look at the performance of the 50 most profitable mobile games that contain a gacha system in 2024.</h5>

    <h3>Looking at the Data</h3>

  <section class="week3Vis">
    <div class="container">
      <h4>What are the 50 most profitable mobile games in 2024? (up until October)</h4>
      <p>
        The following is a breakdown of these games, including their genres and the years they were
        released.
      </p>
  
      <h5>Filter the data by clicking on the genre list or the years!</h5>
      <div id="vis1"></div>
  
      <p>
        In 2024, 14 out of the 50 most profitable games fall under the role-playing genre, indicating that a lot of spenders
        tend to prefer games in that genre. Additionally, at least 10 games were released in 2024. This could mean that some players are simply
        spending to consume all the available content in the game as quickly as possible. It may also be
        due to recency bias, where players feel more inclined to spend their money on games they have just begun playing.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        There seems to be a linear trend regarding the release years of the games. The newer the game, the more likely it is to remain on the most profitable chart. This is likely because the older the game, the more bored players might become, feeling that
        they have experienced everything the game has to offer.
      </p>
  
      <hr>
  
      <h5>Let's look at the best-performing game in 2024</h5>
      <div id="vis2"></div>
      <p>
        While there is no specific trend, it's clear that the revenue gacha games generate
        tends to fluctuate a lot. Some months may be significantly more profitable than others, even when the rates
        offered by the games have not changed. It is the content that changes, which indicates
        that it isn't the rates that affect how players spend, but the content they produce.

      <section class="observe-section honkaiTime addingspace hidden">
        <h4>Part 1 - What is Honkai Star Rail?</h4>
        <p>
          It's a free-to-play role-playing gacha video game developed and
          published by HoYoverse. It is a turn-based game, featuring the main character, the Trailblazer,
          traveling across planets via the Astral Express to help and connect the worlds while resolving
          disasters caused by "Stellarons" and other third parties. The game was publicly released internationally on
          April 26, 2023.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          This game is technically part of HoYoverse's previous series, Honkai. It's the fourth installment
          in the Honkai series, utilizing some characters from Honkai Impact 3rd and gameplay
          elements from their other very popular game, Genshin Impact.

      <h4> Is there a correlation between drop rates and revenue?</h4>
      <p> Based on Honkai: Star Rail's performance, it seems that revenue is affected by the characters popularity more
        than anything. However, does drop rates still play a part in this?</p>
      <p> The following chart looks at the correlation between a game's drop rate with a games revenue. It also looks at
        whether the amount of new players joining the game affects the amount of profit a game gets. An argument could
        be made that new players might be more
        likely to spend money on these games to catch up with more veteran players </p>

      <div id="vis4"> </div>

      <p> Based on this chart, it does look like the revenue isn't affected by the drop rates offered by each game as
        there is a variety of them all throughout. While it seemed like games with lower drop rates tend to have more
        profits,there are still a lot of instances of other games with the same drop rate that doesn't produce even 1/10 of
        another games profit.

      <h4> Finally, is there region that tends to generate the most revenue? </h4>
      <p> While not always the case, mobile games tends to have 3 different servers for the players; Global, Japanese,
        and Chinese servers.</p>
      <p> Depending on where the video game publisher is from, mobile games tend to release in first locally in China or
        Japan. As these games grow in popularity, they
        would create a global server for the rest of the world to be able to properly understand the story of the game.
        This isn't always the case of course
        and some games, like Genshin Impact, released their Chinese and Global servers together. </p>

      <p> There is a believe that the reason some games make a lot of money is their Asian players,
        specifically Japanese and Chinese player. As such, games tend to market themselves
        to that market in hopes of getting them to spend money. </p>

        Japan, this makes a lot of sense!
        With gacha games being a common occurance there, Japanese players are likely more willing to spend on these
        games as its a bit more normalized. </p>

      <p> It is important to note that when China generates revenue, it generates a LOT compared to other regions. If
        you were to look at <b> Love and Deepsace</b>, revenue
        generated by the Chinese servers tends to be at least 5 times what Global and Japan servers combined generate in
        a month. While this is the most drastic difference,
        this can also be seen with titmes such as <b> Genshin Impact, Honkai Star: Rail, and Arknights</b>. </p>
      <p> With this in mind, it makes sense why some video games tend to market itself to a Japanese or Chinese audience
        first, they really are the big
        moneymakers when it comes to it.</p>

        <h4>Profit for these games comes from the characters or the gameplay</h4>
        <p>With gacha games constantly releasing new characters, re-releasing popular ones, 
          or creating new items that are useful for well-liked characters, there will always 
          be players so attached to them that they'd be willing to spend money to obtain these items.</p>
  
        <p>Drop rates also play a part in terms of longevity. Games released between 2012 and 2017 
          had an overall higher drop rate compared to those released from 2018 onwards.</p>
  
        <div id="vis6"></div>
  
        <p>Video games always aim to keep their veteran players happy while ensuring that 
          the game remains fun and accessible for new players. This approach helps maintain 
          the game's longevity by replenishing the player base and preventing decline as older 
          players may stop playing. It also generates potential revenue streams from new users.</p>
  
        <h4>So if the rates are bad, no one wants to play the game!</h4>
        <p>It is crucial to maintain a good balance between the drop rates a game offers, 
          alongside the gameplay and storyline, to ensure the game's success.</p>

          <h4>It is important to keep in mind that gacha can be a dangerous mechanic</h4>
          <p>Gacha as a mechanic is similar to gambling. It doesn’t help that when gamers 
            become attached to a character, many would do ANYTHING to get them. As a video 
            game developer, it is important to be aware of these risks and keep players’ 
            well-being in mind when implementing the gacha mechanic.</p>
