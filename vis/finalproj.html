      <h3> So, whats the issue?</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="week3Vis">
      <div class="container">
        <h4> It's frustrating for players to spend a lot of money on an item that isn't guaranteed</h4>
        <p> Generally, the gacha mechanic is introduced to a free to play game so the developers
          could still make a profit out of it. The items that the player receive got be purely cosmetic
          (doesn't add anything to the gameplay) or actually gives a boost for the player (more attack, new skills) </p>

        <p> Because its not guaranteed, it creates a disparity between players who don't spend money on the game
          and players that do. It's also just frustrating for players to see game devs seemingly caring more about
          profit than the players
        </P>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="column">
            <img src="../img/comment1.png" alt="complaints" style="width:100%">
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="../img/comment2.png" alt="complaints" style="width:100%">
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="../img/comment3.png" alt="complaints" style="width:100%">
            <p> This has always been an issue! It stands true today too</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h4> The gacha games market is also expected to have a compound annual growth rate of 8.8%</h4>

        <div id="gachaMarketTrend"> </div>

        <p> The market is just going to continue growing exponetially. Since it likely to be around 985.7
          million by 2032, its save to say that gacha games will continue getting released</p>

        <h4> As a player, Its frustrating dealing with gacha mechanis!</h4>
        <p> While in app purchases are not required, some games use tactics to make them appealing (timers before
          the deal runs out, a "sale" on the product). On top of that, its very easy to fall behind in these
          games compared to players who are able to spend money on the game to proceed. As such, gacha games
          have a reputation of only existing as a quick cash grab. </p>
          
          <p> By making it so theres only a small chance for players to get the rare items. these companies
          encourage players to spend money in hopes of increasing those chances. However, there's no clear
          proof of this. The question arises on whether the drop rates offered by these games actually affects 
          how players spend on the game or if it is other factors that players may have not considered.
        </p>

        <h4> So, is profit the reason why so many games nowadays include a gacha system?</h4>
        <h5> Let's look at the performance of the 50 most profitable mobile games that contains a gacha system in 2024. </h5>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <div class="sectionIntro" id="section3">
    <h3> Looking at the Data</h3>
  </div>

  <section class="week3Vis">
    <div class="container">
      <h4> What are the 50 most profitale mobile games in 2024? (up until October) </h4>
      <p> The following is a breakdown of these games alongside a breakdown of their genre's and what year the game was released in.
      </p>

      <h5> Filter the data by clicking on the genre list or the years!</h5>
      <div id="vis1"> </div>

      <p> So in 2024, 14 out of the 50 most games fall under the role-playing genre, indicating that a lot of spenders tend to prefer games in that genre.
        On top of that, at least 10 games were released in 2024. This could mean that some players are simply
        spending to consume all the possible contents in that game as quickly as possible. It may also be
        recency bias where players feel more inclined to spend their money to games they just begun.
      </p>

      <p> It seems to be a linear scale in regards to when each game were released.
        The newer the game, the more likely it is to remain on the most profitable chart. Which, again, is ikely
        because the older the game, the more bored a player might be when playing it because they may think that
        they've experienced everything the game has to offer.
      </p>

      <h5> Let's look at the best performing game in 2024</h5>
      <div id="vis2"> </div>
      <p> While there is no specific trend, it's clear that the revenue gacha games generate
        tend to fluctuate a lot. Some months could be way more profitable than others and the rates
        offered by the games would not have changed. It would be the content that change. Which indicates
        that it isn't the rates thats affected how players spend, its the content they produce.
      </p>

        <h3> Let's look at <i> The</i> best selling game in 2024, Honkai Star Rail</h3>
        <section>
        <h4> Part 1 - What is Honkai Star Rail?</h4>
        <p> Its a free-to-play role-playing gacha video game developed and
          published by HoYoverse. It is a turn-based game, featuring the main character, the Trailblazer,
          travelling across planets through the Astral Express to help and connect the worlds while resolving
          disasters caused by "Stellarons" and other third-parties. The game was publicly released internationally on
          April 26, 2023, </p>

        <p> This game is technically part of HoYoverse's previous series, Honkai. Its the fourth installment
          in the Honkai series so it utilizing some characters from Honkai Impact 3rd and some gameplay
          elements from their other very popular game, Genshin Impact.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
        <h4> Part 2 - What happened in March 2024?</h4>

        <p> Two characters were released this month. Jing Yuan and Sparkle. </p>
          <img src="../img/marchBanner.png" alt="Banners in march">

        <h4> Sparkle made her debut in this update</h4>
        <p> With this being the first time Sparkle is released, players are more willing to spend money
          to get her in hopes of her being the most effective characters in the update.
        </p>
        <img src="../img/sparkleBanner.png" alt="Image of the popularity survey results">

        <h4> So, who is Jingyuan?</h4>

        <p> Jingyuan is currently the most popular Honkai Star Rail character 
          based on popularity polls held by Hoyoverse, the publisher. </p>
        <div class="row">

          </div>
        </div>

        <p> Honkai also announced 3 characters that are going to be released in the upcoming
          update of the game. This likely caused some players to immediately spend money to start
          "saving" for those characters in advance.
        </p>

        <h4> The character release announcment was on March 16th, 2024</h4>

    <h4> Is there a correlation between drop rates and revenue?</h4>
      <p> I am still curious to see whether or not there is an overall trend with how drop rates
        can affect the profit for various games as well as whether the number of new players joining the game
        can affect the amount of profit a game gets because an argument could be made that new players might be more
        likely to spend money on these games to catch up with more veteran players </p>

      <div id="vis4"> </div>

      <h4> Finally, is it a regional thing? </h4>
      <p> There is a believe that the reason some games make a lot of money is their Asian players, 
        specifically Japanese and Chinese player. As such, games tend to market themselves
        to that market in hopes of getting them to spend money. </p>
      <p> As we've seen, there is not really much correlation between a games drop rates and 
        their revenue, so lets see if its a regional thing.
      </p>

    <div class="sectionIntro">
      <h3> What have we learnt?</h3>
    </div>

    <section class="week3Vis">
      <div class="container">
        <h4> Profit for these games come from the characters, or the gameplay</h4>
        <p> With gacha games either constantly releasing new characters, re-releasing popular characters,
          or just making new items that is useful for well liked characters, there will be players
          that are so attached to them that they'd be willing to spend money to get those items.</p>

        <p> Drop rates do play a part in terms of longevity. Games released between 2012 to 2017
          had an overall higher drop rate compared to games released in 2018 onwards. </p>
        
        <div id="vis6"> </div>
        
        <p> Video games always want to makes their veteran players happy while ensuring they make it 
          fun and accessible for new players to maintain their game's longevity by replenishing 
          the player base, preventing decline as older players may stop playing and generating 
          potential revenue streams from new users. 
        </p>

        <h4> But likeee, if the rates are bad, no one wants to play the game!</h4>
        <p> So, its very important for them to reach that balance when relesing games. Its not enough to just 
          have pretty characters or design rates, it has to be a mix of both for the game to succeed!
        </p>

        <p> However, it's undeniable that gacha as a mechanic is very predatory. When gamers love get attached
          to a character, a lot of them would do ANYTHING to get them
        </p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="column">

        <h4> So, if you ever want to release a game and make profit (ethically), make the characters
          hot as hell, but still doable to get (give at least a 3% drop rate, trust)
