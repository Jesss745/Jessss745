    <h3> So, whats the issue?</h3>
  </div>

  <section class="week3Vis">
  <div class="container">
      <h4> It's frustrating for players to spend a lot of money on an item that isn't guaranteed</h4>
      <p> Generally, the gacha mechanic is introduced to a free to play game so the developers
        could still make a profit out of it. The items that the player receive got be purely cosmetic
        (doesn't add anything to the gameplay) or actually gives a boost for the player (more attack, new skills) </p>

        <p> Because its not guaranteed, it creates a disparity between players who don't spend money on the game 
          and players that do. It's also just frustrating for players to see game devs seemingly caring more about 
          profit than the players
        </P>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="column">
            <img src="../img/comment1.png" alt="complaints" style="width:100%">

          <div class="column">

          <div class="column">
            <img src="../img/comment3.png" alt="complaints" style="width:100%">
            <p> This one is the realest to be honest, and from 2018 too</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p> According to the Reliable Research IQ, a premier market research firm
        specializing in providing high-quality data research solutions for businesses, The Gacha Games market is
        expected to grow annually by 11.1% by 2031. </p>

      <h4> As a player myself, I get their frustrations!</h4>
      <p> I have my thoughts and seen discussion online on how some players believe
        that gacha games serve no purpose for players except to generate profit and that companies would make
        abhorent gacha rates to force players to keep spending more in their games. However, this idea
        has never really been challange and there is no clear indication on whether the drop rates of the game
        actually affects how players spend on the game or if it is other factors that players may have not considered.
      </p>

      <h4> So, is profit the only reason why companies include a gacha system?</h4>
      <p> I will be focusing on games that are available on mobile and
        I'll currently only be looking at how these games are performing in 2024. </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <div class="sectionIntro">
    <h3> Lets look at the Data</h3>
  </div>

  <section class="week3Vis">
    <div class="container">
      <p> To start I believe it's important for us to see the top 50 best selling mobile gacha games in 2024!
        The following is a breakdown of the 45 best selling mobile gacha games in 2024 alongside a breakdown
        of the different genre's each game falls under and what year the game was released in.
      </p>

      <h5> Filter the data by clicking on the genre list or the years!</h5>

      <div id="vis1"> </div>


      <p> So in 2024, 14 out of the 45 most profitable gacha games fall under the role-playing genre,
        which may indicate that a lot of spenders tend to prefer games in that genre. Adventure comes second with 8.
        On top of that, at least 10 games were released in 2024. This could mean that some players are simply
        spending to consume all the possible contents in that game as quickly as possible. It may also be
        recency bias where players feel more inclined to spend their money to games they just begun.
      </p>

      <p> It seems to be a linear scale in regards to when each game were released.
        The newer the game, the more likely it is to remain on the most profitable chart. Which, again, is ikely
        because
        the older the game, the more bored a player might be when playing it because they may think that
        they've experienced everything the game has to offer.
      </p>

      <h5> So, how does the top 10 games perform each month?</h5>
      <div id="vis2"> </div>
      <p> While there is no specific trend, it's clear that the revenue gacha games generate
        tend to fluctuate a lot. Some months could be way more profitable than others and the rates
        offered by the games would not have changed. It would be the content that change. Which indicates
        that it isn't the rates thats affected how players spend, its the content they produce.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3> Let's look at <i> The</i> best selling game in 2024, Honkai Star Rail</h3>
        <h4> Part 1 - So, what is Honkai Star Rail?</h4>
        <p> Its a free-to-play role-playing gacha video game developed and
          published by HoYoverse. It is a turn-based game, featuring the main character, the Trailblazer,
          travelling across planets through the Astral Express to help and connect the worlds while resolving
          disasters caused by "Stellarons" and other third-parties. The game was publicly released internationally on
          April 26, 2023, </p>

        <p> This game is technically part of HoYoverse's previous series, Honkai. Its the fourth installment
          in the Honkai series so it utilizing some characters from Honkai Impact 3rd and some gameplay
          elements from their other very popular game, Genshin Impact.</p>

        <h4> Part 2 - What happened in March 2024?</h4>

        <p>2 highly anticipated characters were re-released this month (Jing Yuan, 1st in the most recent anniversary
          popularity vote) and another character that is going
          to be released in late March (Archeron, 4th in the most recent anniversary popularity vote).
          It's very likely that this is why people ended up spending a lot of money, they wanted to either
          get JingYuan that month, or begin saving for Archeron.
        </p>

        <img src="../img/jingyuan.png" alt="Image of the popularity survey results">
        <p> Here is the winner announcement post HOYOVERSE (the publisher) made for Honkai's 1st anniversarry</p>
      </section>

      <h3> Now, are you curious how other games compare to Honkai? (or other games!)</h3>
      <h5> If you want to try comparing 2 games with each other, you can do so here! </h5>

      <div class="dropdown-container">
        <select id="dropdown1">
          <option value="">Select first Game</option>
        </select>
        <select id="dropdown2">
          <option value="">Select second Game</option>
        </select>
      </div>
      <div id="vis3"> </div>

      <p> However, I am still curious to see whether or not there is an overall trend with how drop rates
        can affect the profit for various games as well as whether the number of new players joining the game
        can affect the amount of profit a game gets because an argument could be made that new players might be more
        likely to spend money on these games to catch up with more veteran players </p>
